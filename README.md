# Using a project where `renv` is already setup

If a collaborator has already setup an renv environment for the project, 
you can leverage this to ensure you use the dependencies, 
and versions of those dependencies, as your collaborator ðŸ™Œ

### Let's try it out!

1. Click the green "Use this template" button 
in [this repository](https://github.com/ttimbers/renv-demo)

2. Clone this repository to your computer.

3. Open RStudio to the project working directory 
by double-clicking on the `*.Rproj` file.

4. Run `renv::restore()` to restore the project library locally on your machine.

5. Click the "Knit" button to run the code and reproduce the analysis!
